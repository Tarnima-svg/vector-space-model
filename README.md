The Vector Space Model (VSM) is a mathematical model used in information retrieval and natural language processing to represent text documents as vectors in a high-dimensional space. In this model, each document is represented as a vector, and each dimension of the vector corresponds to a particular term in the vocabulary.

1. Document-Term Matrix: First, a document-term matrix is created, where each row represents a document, each column represents a unique term in the vocabulary, and the values in the matrix represent the frequency of each term in the corresponding document.

2. Vector Representation: Each document is then represented as a vector in this high-dimensional space, where the dimensions of the vector correspond to the terms in the vocabulary, and the values represent the importance or frequency of each term in the document.

3. Term Weighting: Various techniques can be used to weight the terms in the vectors, such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), which takes into account both the frequency of a term in a document and its rarity across all documents.

4. Similarity Calculation: Once the documents are represented as vectors, similarity between documents can be calculated using metrics such as cosine similarity, which measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors. Documents with similar content will have vectors that point in similar directions in the vector space and thus have a smaller angle between them.
