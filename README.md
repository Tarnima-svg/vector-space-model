# Vector Space Model (VSM) Implementation

This repository contains code to implement the Vector Space Model (VSM) for information retrieval and text analysis.

## Overview

The Vector Space Model is a mathematical model used in information retrieval and natural language processing to represent text documents as vectors in a high-dimensional space. This implementation allows you to analyze the relevance of documents to a given query term using the VSM approach.

## Features

- Tokenization and preprocessing of documents and query terms.
- Calculation of the Term-Document Matrix (TDM) to represent documents.
- Calculation of Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) to weigh the importance of terms.
- Computation of TF-IDF scores for each term in each document.
- Calculation of cosine similarity between documents and query terms.


## Usage

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Tarnima-svg/vector-space-model.git
