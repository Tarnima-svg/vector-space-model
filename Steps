Let's break down the steps for implementing the Vector Space Model (VSM)

Prepare Documents and Query:
Documents: "Cat runs behind rat." and "Dog runs behind cat."
Query term: "rat."

Tokenization and Preprocessing:
Documents broken down into words:
Document 1: ["Cat", "runs", "behind", "rat"]
Document 2: ["Dog", "runs", "behind", "cat"]
Query: ["rat"]
Stopwords, punctuation, and special characters are removed.

Term-Document Matrix (TDM):
TDM (document-term matrix) created:
+-------------------------------------+
|  Term   | Document 1	| Document 2 |
|  Cat	  |      1	    |      0     |
|  runs	  |      1	    |      1     |
| behind	|      1	    |      1     |
|  rat	  |      1	    |      0     |
|  Dog	  |      0	    |      1     |
+-------------------------------------+
Total number of documents (N) = 2

Calculate Inverse Document Frequency (IDF):
Calculate Document Frequency (df) for each term.
Compute IDF using the formula: IDF = log(N / df).

Calculate TF-IDF:
Compute Term Frequency (TF) for each term in each document.
Multiply TF by IDF to get the TF-IDF score for each term in each document.

Cosine Similarity:
Calculate cosine similarity between each document and the query.
Compute dot product (x*y) and magnitudes (||x|| and ||y||) for each document-term vector and query-term vector.
Compute cosine similarity (CS) using the formula: CS = (x * y) / (||x|| * ||y||).

Output:
Compare cosine similarity scores for each document and the query.
The document with the higher similarity score is considered more relevant to the query.

e.g.         +-------------------+
             |   Document 1      |
             | "Cat runs behind  |
             |       rat."       |
             +---------+---------+
                       |
                       |    cosine similarity
                       |    
                +------v------+
                |    Query    |
                |    "rat"    |
                +------+------+
                       |
                       |
                       |    cosine similarity
             +---------v---------+
             |   Document 2      |
             | "Dog runs behind  |
             |       cat."       |
             +-------------------+

In this diagram:
1. Each rectangle represents a document or the query.
2. The content of each document or the query is written inside the rectangle.
3. Arrows indicate the cosine similarity calculation between documents and the query.
4. The length of the arrows represents the similarity score, with longer arrows indicating higher similarity.
