# vector-space-model
The Vector Space Model (VSM) is a mathematical model used in information retrieval and natural language processing to represent text documents as vectors in a high-dimensional space. In this model, each document is represented as a vector, and each dimension of the vector corresponds to a particular term in the vocabulary.
